# ✅ GOOGLE AUTH REDIRECT FIX

## Problem Fixed
❌ **Before:** Clicking "Google" button redirected to `http://localhost:8100/?code=...` (wrong port + callback page)
✅ **After:** Clicking "Google" button goes directly to PT Trainer Dashboard

## What Was Wrong

The login was using **Supabase OAuth** (`signInWithOAuth`):
- Redirects to a different port (8100 instead of 8080)
- Shows an OAuth callback page with code parameter
- Doesn't give calendar access
- User had to close/navigate manually

## What I Changed

**File:** `lib/screens/enhanced_login_screen.dart`

### Changed From: Supabase OAuth
```dart
await SupabaseService.instance.signInWithGoogle();
// → Redirects to http://localhost:8100/?code=xxx
```

### Changed To: Direct Google Sign-In
```dart
await GoogleCalendarService.instance.promptGoogleSignIn();
// → Shows Google OAuth popup
// → Gets calendar access
// → Navigates directly to dashboard
```

## Benefits of the Fix

✅ **No redirect to callback URL** - Stays on your app (localhost:8080)
✅ **Direct navigation to dashboard** - No intermediate pages
✅ **Calendar access granted** - Ready for calendar sync
✅ **Better UX** - Clean, seamless flow

## How It Works Now

```
User clicks "Google" button
    ↓
Google OAuth popup appears
    ↓
User selects Google account
    ↓
Grants calendar permissions
    ↓
Popup closes
    ↓
✅ Success message shows
    ↓
Navigates directly to PT Trainer Dashboard

```

## Test the Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. **Click "Google" button** on login screen
3. **Sign in** with your Google account
4. **Grant calendar permissions**
5. **Expected:** You'll be taken directly to the Trainer Dashboard
6. **No more redirect** to localhost:8100!

## Console Messages You'll See

```
✅ Google Sign-In successful: your-email@gmail.com
🎯 Navigating to trainer dashboard...
✓ Successfully signed in with Google!
```

## Calendar Sync Status

Now when you book a session, you'll see:
```
📅 Using WEB-specific calendar implementation
🔍 Checking Google Sign-In status...
✅ User signed in: your-email@gmail.com
✅ Got access token for web calendar API
🚀 Calling web calendar API...
✅ SUCCESS! Calendar event created!
```

## If Sign-In Fails

The app will automatically fall back to **Demo Mode**:
- Shows orange notification
- Still lets you use the app
- Calendar sync won't work until you sign in with Google

## 🎯 READY TO TEST
