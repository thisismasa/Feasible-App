# Fix: "Google sign-in was cancelled"

## üî¥ Common Causes

### 1. **Popup Blocker** (Most Common)
Chrome is blocking the Google OAuth popup window.

### 2. **You Closed the Popup**
The popup opened but was accidentally closed.

### 3. **Browser Security Policy**
Mobile browsers (especially Safari) have strict popup policies.

### 4. **OAuth Not Yet Propagated**
Google needs 5 minutes after saving OAuth changes.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: Enable Popups in Chrome

### Method A: Quick Fix (Address Bar)

1. Look at the **address bar** in Chrome
2. Look for a **popup blocked icon** (usually on the right side)
3. Click it
4. Select **"Always allow popups from this site"**
5. Click "Done"
6. **Refresh the page** (F5)
7. Try Google sign-in again

### Method B: Chrome Settings

1. Open: `chrome://settings/content/popups`
2. Under **"Allowed to send pop-ups"**, click **"Add"**
3. Paste: `https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com`
4. Click **"Add"**
5. **Refresh your app page**

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 2: Check Browser Console

### Open Developer Console:

1. Press **F12** in Chrome
2. Click **"Console"** tab
3. Click the **red "Google"** button
4. **Watch for error messages**

### Common Errors You Might See:

**Error 1: "Popup blocked"**
```
Blocked opening 'https://accounts.google.com' in a popup
```
**Fix:** Enable popups (Solution 1 above)

**Error 2: "Invalid origin"**
```
Origin mismatch: https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com
```
**Fix:** OAuth not updated yet. Wait 5 minutes or add URL to OAuth.

**Error 3: "idpiframe_initialization_failed"**
```
Not a valid origin for the client
```
**Fix:** OAuth Client doesn't have the Cloudflare URL yet.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 3: Test in Incognito Mode

Sometimes extensions or cached data cause issues.

1. Open **Incognito Window**: Ctrl+Shift+N
2. Go to: `https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com`
3. Allow popups if prompted
4. Click **"Google"** button
5. Sign in

**If it works in Incognito:**
- Clear browser cache/cookies in normal mode
- Or just use Incognito for now

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 4: Verify OAuth Configuration

### Check Google Cloud Console:

1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/576001465184-pv04h51b3pl92hkdibgssabm2cegbq6r.apps.googleusercontent.com

2. **Verify "Authorized JavaScript origins" includes:**
   ```
   https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com
   ```

3. **Verify "Authorized redirect URIs" includes:**
   ```
   https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com
   ```

4. **Check last modified time:**
   - Should be recent (within last 10 minutes)
   - If older, you might have forgotten to click "SAVE"

5. **If recently saved:**
   - Wait 5 minutes for Google to propagate
   - Don't test immediately after saving!

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 5: Test on Desktop First

**If you're on iPhone/mobile:**

Mobile browsers (especially Safari) are MUCH harder for OAuth:
- Stricter popup blocking
- Different security policies
- Cookie restrictions

**Recommended Testing Order:**

1. **Desktop Chrome** (easiest) ‚Üê Start here!
2. Desktop Chrome Incognito
3. Desktop Edge/Firefox
4. Mobile Chrome (if available)
5. Mobile Safari (last resort)

**Test on desktop first to confirm OAuth is working!**

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 6: Manual Popup Test

Let's test if popups work at all:

1. Open: `https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com`
2. Press **F12** ‚Üí **Console** tab
3. Paste this code and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   window.open('https://google.com', '_blank', 'width=500,height=600');
   ```
4. **Did a popup open?**
   - ‚úÖ **Yes:** Popups work! OAuth issue is something else.
   - ‚ùå **No:** Popup blocker is active. Enable popups first.

## üìä Quick Checklist

Before testing again:

- [ ] OAuth Client has NEW URL: `chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com`
- [ ] Saved OAuth changes (clicked "SAVE")
- [ ] Waited 5 minutes after saving
- [ ] Testing on **desktop Chrome** (not mobile)
- [ ] Popups enabled for the site
- [ ] **Not** in private/incognito (try normal mode first)
- [ ] Developer Console open (F12) to see errors

---

## üéØ Most Likely Solution

Based on "sign-in was cancelled", here's what's probably happening:

1. **Popup is being blocked by Chrome**
   - Chrome blocks popups by default for new sites
   - You need to manually allow popups

2. **OR you're on mobile Safari**
   - Safari blocks OAuth popups aggressively
   - Test on desktop Chrome instead

**Try this NOW:**

1. Open Chrome on your **Windows PC**
2. Go to: `https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com`
3. Press **F12** ‚Üí **Console** tab
4. Click the **red "Google" button**
5. **If popup blocked** ‚Üí Allow popups in settings
6. **If popup opens** ‚Üí Sign in and click "Allow"
7. **Report what happens!**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dkdnpceoanwbeulhkvdh/logs/edge-logs
2. Click "Google" button to trigger sign-in
3. Check for errors in Supabase logs
