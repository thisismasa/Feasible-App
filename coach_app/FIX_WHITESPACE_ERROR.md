# Fix "Invalid Origin: cannot contain whitespace"

## The Problem

When you paste the URL, Google says:
```
Invalid Origin: cannot contain whitespace
```

**What happened:**
- You accidentally copied a space before or after the URL
- Or there's a line break in the copy

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Copy from This File

I've created a clean file with ONLY the URL (no spaces, no line breaks).

### Step 1: Copy the Clean URL

**Option A: Auto-copied (Recommended)**
The clean URL is now in your clipboard! Just paste it.

**Option B: Copy from file**
Open this file:
```
EXACT_URL_TO_ADD.txt
```
Select all the text (Ctrl+A), then copy (Ctrl+C)

### Step 2: Add to Google OAuth

In the OAuth Client page:

**For "Authorized JavaScript origins":**
1. Click "+ ADD URI"
2. Click in the text box
3. Press Ctrl+V (paste)
4. **DO NOT type anything else**
5. **DO NOT press space**
6. Press Tab or click outside the box

**For "Authorized redirect URIs":**
7. Click "+ ADD URI"
8. Click in the text box
9. Press Ctrl+V (paste)
10. **DO NOT type anything else**
11. **DO NOT press space**
12. Press Tab or click outside the box

### Step 3: Save

13. Scroll to bottom
14. Click "SAVE"

## The Exact URL (Copy This)

```
https://tones-dancing-patches-searching.trycloudflare.com
```

**Make sure:**
- ❌ No space at the beginning
- ❌ No space at the end
- ❌ No line break
- ✅ Just the URL exactly as shown

## How to Check If You Copied It Right

After pasting in the Google field:

**Wrong (has spaces):**
```
 https://tones-dancing-patches-searching.trycloudflare.com
  ↑ Space here = ERROR!
```

```
https://tones-dancing-patches-searching.trycloudflare.com
                                                           ↑ Space here = ERROR!
```

**Correct (no spaces):**
```
https://tones-dancing-patches-searching.trycloudflare.com
↑ Starts immediately                                     ↑ Ends immediately
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Copy from this document with extra formatting
**Wrong:** Copy from a Word doc or formatted text

### Mistake 2: Type it manually
**Wrong:** Typing the URL character by character
**Right:** Copy/paste from the .txt file

### Mistake 3: Copy from browser address bar
**Wrong:** Browser might add extra characters
**Right:** Use the .txt file I created

### Mistake 4: Press Enter or Space after pasting

## If Still Getting Error

### Try This:

1. **Select the URL in EXACT_URL_TO_ADD.txt**
   - Open the file
   - Triple-click to select all
   - Ctrl+C to copy

2. **In Google OAuth client page:**
   - Click "+ ADD URI"
   - Click in the empty field
   - Ctrl+V to paste
   - **Immediately press Tab key** (don't press anything else)

3. **Check what appears:**
   - Look at the URL that appears
   - Is there a space at the start? Remove it
   - Is there a space at the end? Remove it
   - Use arrow keys to check both ends

4. **If error persists:**
   - Delete the entry (click X)
   - Try again
   - Make sure you're not pressing Space or Enter accidentally

## Manual Entry (Last Resort)

If copy/paste keeps failing, type it EXACTLY:

```
https://tones-dancing-patches-searching.trycloudflare.com
```

**Character by character:**
- h-t-t-p-s-:-/-/-t-o-n-e-s--d-a-n-c-i-n-g--p-a-t-c-h-e-s--s-e-a-r-c-h-i-n-g-.-t-r-y-c-l-o-u-d-f-l-a-r-e-.-c-o-m

**Watch for:**
- All lowercase
- Hyphens (-) not underscores (_)
- .com at the end (not .org or .net)
- No www.
- https:// not http://

## Quick Test

After adding the URL, before saving:

1. Copy your entry
2. Paste it in Notepad
3. Check if it looks EXACTLY like:
   ```
