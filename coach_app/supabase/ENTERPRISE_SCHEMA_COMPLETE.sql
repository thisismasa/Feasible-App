## üìã Implementation Plan:

The full SQL implementation is documented in `ENTERPRISE_BOOKING_ARCHITECTURE.md` (just created).

### To implement:
1. Review the architecture document
2. Run SQL scripts in order
3. Test each feature incrementally
4. Integrate with Flutter UI

## üéØ Current Status:

‚úÖ **Architecture Complete** - Full design documented
‚è≥ **Implementation** - Ready to build incrementally based on priority

Would you like me to:
1. Implement specific features first (e.g., recurring sessions)?
2. Create the complete SQL schema now?
3. Build the enhanced UI components?
4. Focus on a specific dimension?

**Note**: Given the scope, I recommend implementing features incrementally rather than all at once, to ensure each works correctly before adding complexity.

Let me know which feature you'd like to implement first!
