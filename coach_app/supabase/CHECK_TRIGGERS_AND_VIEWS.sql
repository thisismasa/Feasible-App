-- EXPECTED FINDINGS:
-- ============================================================================
-- If this shows NO results in CHECK 6, then the database is truly clean.
-- If Flutter still shows error, then it must be:
-- 1. Supabase client cached schema
-- 2. Wrong Supabase project URL
-- 3. Flutter using old .env file with different database
