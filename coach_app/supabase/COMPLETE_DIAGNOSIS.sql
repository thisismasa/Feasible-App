-- COMPLETE DIAGNOSIS: Payment to Package Flow
-- ============================================================================
-- This checks EVERY step from payment to showing active package
-- ============================================================================

-- STEP 1: Find ALL clients named Nuttapon or similar
SELECT
  'üë• ALL MATCHING CLIENTS' as info,
  id,
  full_name,
  email,
  phone,
  role,
  created_at
FROM users
WHERE full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
   OR email ILIKE '%natt%'
   OR phone LIKE '%0987654321%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- STEP 2: Check ALL packages for these clients
SELECT
  'üì¶ ALL PACKAGES FOR THESE CLIENTS' as info,
  cp.*
FROM client_packages cp
WHERE cp.client_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users
  WHERE full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
     OR email ILIKE '%natt%'
     OR phone LIKE '%0987654321%'
)
ORDER BY cp.created_at DESC;

-- STEP 3: Check ALL payment transactions
SELECT
  'üí∞ ALL PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS' as info,
  pt.*
FROM payment_transactions pt
WHERE pt.client_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users
  WHERE full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
     OR email ILIKE '%natt%'
     OR phone LIKE '%0987654321%'
)
ORDER BY pt.created_at DESC;

-- STEP 4: Check table structure
SELECT
  'üîß CLIENT_PACKAGES STRUCTURE' as info,
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  column_default,
  is_generated,
  generation_expression

WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'client_packages'

-- STEP 5: Check if there are ANY active packages at all
SELECT
  'üìä ALL ACTIVE PACKAGES IN SYSTEM' as info,
  COUNT(*) as total_active_packages
FROM client_packages
WHERE status = 'active';

-- STEP 6: Check what the Flutter app is querying
-- This mimics the exact query from real_supabase_service.dart line 714
SELECT
  'üîç WHAT FLUTTER QUERIES (mimicking code)' as info,
  cp.*,
  p.name as package_details_name,

  SELECT id FROM users
  WHERE full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
     OR email ILIKE '%natt%'
)
  AND cp.status = 'active'
ORDER BY cp.created_at DESC;

-- STEP 7: Check if sessions_remaining exists and has values
SELECT
  'üéØ SESSIONS_REMAINING CHECK' as info,
  id,
  package_name,
  total_sessions,
  sessions_used,
  sessions_scheduled,
  sessions_remaining,

  END as status
FROM client_packages
WHERE client_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users
  WHERE full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
     OR email ILIKE '%natt%'
);

-- STEP 8: Find the EXACT issue
SELECT
  'üîç EXACT ISSUE DIAGNOSIS' as info,
  u.full_name,
  u.email,
  cp.id as package_id,
  cp.package_name,
  cp.status,
  cp.payment_status,

    WHEN cp.payment_status != 'paid' THEN '‚ùå payment_status = ' || cp.payment_status
    WHEN cp.sessions_remaining IS NULL THEN '‚ùå sessions_remaining is NULL'
    WHEN cp.sessions_remaining <= 0 THEN '‚ùå sessions_remaining = ' || cp.sessions_remaining::text
    WHEN cp.expiry_date < NOW() THEN '‚ùå EXPIRED on ' || cp.expiry_date::text
    ELSE '‚úÖ SHOULD BE VISIBLE'
  END as issue,
  cp.created_at
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN client_packages cp ON u.id = cp.client_id
WHERE u.full_name ILIKE '%nutt%'
   OR u.email ILIKE '%natt%'
   OR u.phone LIKE '%0987654321%'
ORDER BY cp.created_at DESC NULLS LAST;
