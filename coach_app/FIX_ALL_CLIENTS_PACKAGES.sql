-- ============================================
-- ‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER RUNNING
-- ============================================
--
-- SECTION 1: Shows current status (before fix)
-- - Some clients will show "‚ùå CANNOT BOOK"
--
-- SECTION 2: Applies 6 fixes to ALL packages
-- - UPDATE statements will show how many fixed
--
-- SECTION 3: Shows status after fix
-- - ALL clients should show "‚úÖ CAN BOOK"
--
-- SECTION 4: Detailed view of every package
-- - All packages should show "‚úÖ READY"
--
-- SECTION 5: Validation tests for each package
-- - All should show "‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASS"
--
-- SECTION 6: Summary statistics
-- - clients_who_can_book should equal total_clients
-- - ready_to_book_packages should equal total_packages
--
-- ============================================
-- üéØ WHAT THIS FIXES FOR ALL CLIENTS
-- ============================================
-- ‚úÖ Activates all packages
-- ‚úÖ Sets remaining_sessions (10 or total)
-- ‚úÖ Extends expiry_date by 90 days
-- ‚úÖ Sets start_date to today
-- ‚úÖ Links to active package plans
-- ‚úÖ Sets total_sessions if missing
--
-- ALL clients will be able to book after this!
