# How to Login - IMPORTANT!

## ‚ùå Wrong Way (What You're Doing)

You're using **Email/Password login**:
- Entering: `masathomardforwork@gmail.com`
- Entering: password
- Clicking: "Sign In to Dashboard"
- **Result:** "Invalid login credentials" error ‚ùå

**Why it fails:**
- You don't have a password-based account in Supabase
- We set up **Google OAuth** login, not email/password
- These are two different authentication methods

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Way (What You Should Do)

Use **Google Sign-In**:

### Step 1: Look at the Bottom Section

Below "Or continue with", you'll see buttons:

- **[G] Google** ‚Üê Click THIS one!
- [D] Demo Login
- [Fingerprint] Biometric
- [Face] Face ID

### Step 2: Click the "Google" Button

The button with the "G" logo.

### Step 3: Google OAuth Flow

1. Popup window opens
2. Select: `masathomardforwork@gmail.com`
3. May see "unverified app" warning ‚Üí Click "Continue"
4. Click "Allow" for permissions
5. Redirects to dashboard
6. ‚úÖ Success!

## Why Google OAuth?

**Google OAuth provides:**
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication (no password storage)
- ‚úÖ Calendar API access (for booking sync)
- ‚úÖ Email and profile info
- ‚úÖ Single sign-on

**Email/Password would need:**
- ‚ùå Separate account creation
- ‚ùå Password management
- ‚ùå Email verification
- ‚ùå Manual setup in Supabase
