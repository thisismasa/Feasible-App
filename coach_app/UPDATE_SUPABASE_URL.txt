========================================
  UPDATE SUPABASE WITH NEW URL
========================================

NEW URL (already in clipboard):
https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com

========================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
========================================

The Supabase URL Configuration page is now open.

1. Find "Site URL" field
   - Clear the old URL
   - Paste the NEW URL: https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com

2. Find "Redirect URLs" section
   - Remove old URL if present:
     ❌ https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com

   - Add NEW URL:
     ✅ https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com

   - Also add with wildcard (if not there):
     ✅ https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com/**

3. Click "SAVE" at bottom

4. Wait for "Settings saved" confirmation

========================================
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT:
========================================

Supabase uses these URLs to:
- Validate OAuth redirects from Google
- Allow callbacks after sign-in
- Security verification

If Supabase has the WRONG URL:
- Google sign-in will FAIL
- "Redirect URI mismatch" error
- "Sign-in was cancelled" error

Both Google OAuth AND Supabase need the SAME URL!

========================================
AFTER SAVING:
========================================

✅ Google OAuth Client: Updated with chronic-speed-price-best
✅ Supabase URLs: Updated with chronic-speed-price-best
✅ Both saved and confirmed

Then:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes (for changes to propagate)
2. Enable popups in Chrome
3. Refresh app page
4. Click "Google" button
5. Should work!

========================================
URL IN CLIPBOARD:
========================================

https://chronic-speed-price-best.trycloudflare.com

Just paste with Ctrl+V in Supabase!
