# MULTI-TRAINER SYSTEM - Complete Guide

## Overview

Your database is now upgraded to support **UNLIMITED trainers (PTs)** for the future. This is not just for you, but designed for your business to scale with multiple trainers.

## System Architecture

### 1. Trainer Management
- **Multiple Trainer Accounts**: Create unlimited trainer accounts
- **Trainer Profiles**: Each trainer has a detailed profile with:
  - Professional info (certifications, specialization, experience)
  - Business settings (commission rate, max capacity)
  - Performance metrics (ratings, sessions completed)
  - Social media links

### 2. Client Assignment
- **Trainer-Client Relationship**: Each client is assigned to a specific trainer
- **Client Transfer**: Transfer clients between trainers with full history
- **Auto-Assignment**: New clients automatically assigned to trainers
- **Multi-Client Support**: Trainers can have multiple clients

### 3. Booking System
- **Trainer-Specific Bookings**: Each booking linked to specific trainer
- **Availability Management**: Trainers set their own working hours
- **Time-Off Tracking**: Vacation/sick days automatically block bookings
- **Conflict Prevention**: System prevents double-booking trainers

### 4. Package Management
- **Trainer-Specific Packages**: Track which trainer sold the package
- **Custom Pricing**: Trainers can have custom pricing per package
- **Session Tracking**: Track sessions per trainer-client relationship

### 5. Security & Privacy
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Trainers only see their own data
- **Client Privacy**: Clients can't see other clients
- **Admin Override**: Admin account can see everything
- **Secure Access**: Each trainer has their own login
