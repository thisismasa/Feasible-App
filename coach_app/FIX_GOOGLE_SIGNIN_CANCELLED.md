# Fix: Google Sign-In Was Cancelled

## Error You're Seeing
```
Google sign-in failed: Exception: Google sign-in was cancelled

Try again or use Email/Password login.
```

## Why This Happens

### Cause 1: Popup Blocked (Most Common on Mobile)
Mobile Safari blocks popups by default.

### Cause 2: You Closed the Popup
The Google OAuth popup opened but was closed before completing.

### Cause 3: OAuth Not Configured for Cloudflare URL
The Cloudflare URL isn't in authorized origins yet.

### Cause 4: Mobile Browser Issues
Mobile Safari has stricter OAuth/popup policies than desktop.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Test on Desktop First

Mobile browsers are harder to debug. Let's test on **desktop Chrome** first.

### Step 1: Open on Desktop (PC/Laptop)

**On your Windows PC:**

1. Open **Google Chrome** (desktop version)
2. Go to: `https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com`
3. Click the red **"Google"** button
4. A popup should open
5. **DON'T close the popup!**
6. Sign in with: `masathomardforwork@gmail.com`
7. Click "Allow"
8. Should work!

---

## If Desktop Chrome Works:

Then it's a **mobile browser issue**. Solutions for iPhone:

### Solution A: Enable Popups in Safari (iPhone)

1. Open **Settings** app on iPhone
2. Scroll to **Safari**
3. Find **"Block Pop-ups"**
4. **Turn it OFF**
5. Close Settings
6. Try again in Safari

### Solution B: Use Chrome on iPhone

1. Install **Chrome app** from App Store
2. Open Chrome
3. Go to the Cloudflare URL
4. Click "Google" button
5. Should work better than Safari

### Solution C: Use Desktop Browser

For now, use your **Windows PC** to access the app. Mobile can come later.

## If Desktop Chrome Also Fails:

Then OAuth isn't configured correctly. Check this:

### Verify OAuth Client Configuration

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/576001465184-pv04h51b3pl92hkdibgssabm2cegbq6r.apps.googleusercontent.com

2. **Check "Authorized JavaScript origins"** - Should include:
   ```
   https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com
   ```

3. **Check "Authorized redirect URIs"** - Should include:
   ```
   https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com
   ```

4. **If missing:**
   - Click "+ ADD URI"
   - Paste the URL
   - Click "SAVE"
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Try again

---

## Check Popup Blocker (Desktop Chrome)

### How to Allow Popups:

1. In Chrome, click the **address bar**
2. Look for a **blocked popup icon** (ðŸš« or similar)
3. Click it
4. Select **"Always allow popups from this site"**
5. Try Google sign-in again

### Or in Chrome Settings:

1. Go to: `chrome://settings/content/popups`
2. Under "Allowed to send pop-ups", click **"Add"**
3. Enter: `https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com`
4. Click "Add"
5. Try again

---

## Debug: What Happens When You Click Google Button?

### Expected Flow:
1. Click "Google" button
2. **Popup window opens** (small window with Google sign-in)
3. Select your Google account
4. Click "Allow"
5. Popup closes
6. Main window redirects to dashboard

### If Popup Doesn't Open:
- **Blocked by browser** â†’ Enable popups
- **Flashes and closes** â†’ OAuth redirect issue
- **Nothing happens** â†’ JavaScript error (check console)

### If Popup Opens Then Closes:
- **You closed it** â†’ Don't close, complete the sign-in
- **Error in popup** â†’ OAuth not configured
- **Redirects to error** â†’ Check authorized URLs

---

## Test Checklist

Before testing again:

### OAuth Configuration:
- [ ] Email `masathomardforwork@gmail.com` in test users
- [ ] URL in "Authorized JavaScript origins"
- [ ] URL in "Authorized redirect URIs"
- [ ] Clicked "SAVE"
- [ ] Waited 5 minutes

### Browser Setup:
- [ ] Using desktop Chrome (not mobile Safari)
- [ ] Popups enabled for the site
- [ ] Not in private/incognito initially (test normal mode first)
- [ ] JavaScript enabled
- [ ] Cookies enabled

### Testing:
- [ ] Clicked "Google" button (red button with G)
- [ ] Popup window appeared
- [ ] Didn't close the popup manually
- [ ] Signed in with masathomardforwork@gmail.com
- [ ] Clicked "Allow" for permissions

---

## Quick Commands

### Open on Desktop Chrome:
```bash
start chrome "https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com"
```

### Check OAuth Client:
```bash
start https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/576001465184-pv04h51b3pl92hkdibgssabm2cegbq6r.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Enable Chrome Popups:
```
chrome://settings/content/popups
```

---

## Recommended Testing Order

1. **Desktop Chrome** (easiest to debug)
   - Test here first
   - Check popup blocker
   - Verify OAuth works

2. **Desktop Chrome Incognito**
   - Clear any cached errors
   - Fresh OAuth flow

3. **Desktop Edge/Firefox**
   - Verify it's not Chrome-specific

4. **Mobile Chrome** (if available)
   - Better popup handling than Safari

5. **Mobile Safari** (last resort)
   - Enable popups in Settings
   - May still have issues

---

## Mobile-Specific Issues

### Why Mobile Safari Is Problematic:

1. **Stricter popup blocking** - Blocks unless user-initiated
2. **OAuth redirect issues** - Popup â†’ redirect â†’ original tab
3. **Cookie policies** - Third-party cookies restricted
4. **Security policies** - More restrictive than desktop

### Workarounds:

1. **Use desktop browser** for now
2. **Use Chrome on iPhone** instead of Safari
3. **Native app** would work better (Flutter iOS build)
4. **Alternative auth** - Use demo login for mobile testing

---

## Alternative: Use Demo Login (For Testing)

If Google OAuth keeps failing on mobile:

1. Click the **"Demo Login"** button (blue button with play icon)
2. This bypasses OAuth
3. You can test app features
4. Fix Google OAuth separately

---

## Summary

**Immediate Action:**

1. **Test on desktop Chrome FIRST**
   - Easier to debug
   - Better popup support
   - Check OAuth configuration

2. **Verify OAuth URLs are added**
   - JavaScript origins
   - Redirect URIs
   - Wait 5 minutes after saving

3. **Enable popups in Chrome**
   - Check address bar for blocked popup icon
   - Allow popups for the site

4. **Try mobile Safari AFTER desktop works**
   - Enable popups in iPhone Settings
   - Or use Chrome on iPhone

**Most likely issue:**
- You're on mobile (iPhone)
- Safari blocking popup
- OR OAuth URL not added yet

**Best solution:**
- Test on desktop Chrome first
- Add OAuth URLs if missing
- Then try mobile once it works on desktop

---

**Run this now to test on desktop:**

```bash
cd Feasible-App/coach_app
start chrome "https://notes-injuries-comparing-programming.trycloudflare.com"
```

Then click the Google button and watch if a popup opens!
